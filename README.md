# What is Scrapoxy ?

Scrapoxy is a **[proxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_server) for [scrapers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_scraping)**.

You can crawl without thinking about hiding your IP address or avoiding IP blacklisting.

It is written in [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) and it is open source!


## How does Scrapoxy work ?

1. When Scrapoxy starts, it creates and manages a pool of proxies.
2. Your scraper uses Scrapoxy as a normal proxy. 
3. Scrapoxy routes all requests through a pool of proxies.

## What Scrapoxy does ?

- Create your own pool of proxies
- Route requests fairly (with round-robin by domain)
- Use standard User Agent (Chrome, Firefox and Safari)
- Rotate IP address
- Use multiple cloud platforms (in progress, done: AWS EC2)
- Control the pool from your scraper


## Why Scrapoxy doesn't support anti-blacklisting ?

Anti-blacklisting is a job for the scraper.

When the scraper detects blacklisting, it asks Scrapoxy to remove the proxy from the proxies pool (through a REST API).


## What is the best scraper framework to use with Scrapoxy ?

You could use [Scrapy framework](http://scrapy.org) ([Python](https://www.python.org)).
